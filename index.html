      <h1>About :</h1>
      <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was
        an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
        spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
        mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
        India's civilian space programme and military missile development
        efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
        work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
        technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
        first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5] Kalam was
        elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both
        the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian
        National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
        after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
        including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While
        delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
        Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July
        2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
        attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where
        he was buried with full state honours.

      <h1>Early life and education :</h1>
      <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
        Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
        Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
        Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
        local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13]
        His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
        Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the
        youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His
        ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
        numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
        ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
        from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
        trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
        Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
        With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however,
        the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
        the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
        poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to
        sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21] In
        his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright
        and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours
        on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his
        education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam
        went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then
        affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in
        physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace
        engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was
        working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his
        lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the
        project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,
        impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under
        stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly
        missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
        ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the
        IAF.[24]

      <h1>Career as a scientist :</h1>
      <p>
        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam
        joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
        Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
        Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by
        designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of
        a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
        Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and
        recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba
        Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was
        transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he
        was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
        (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth
        orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket
        project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the
        government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
        engineers.[25] Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati In
        1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton,
        Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and
        Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made
        an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and
        SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful. Kalam was
        invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test
        Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not
        participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two
        projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop
        ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV
        programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime
        Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace
        projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's
        directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union
        Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace
        projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought him great
        laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to
        initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[29] Kalam
        and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the
        Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister,
        R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver
        of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[30] R
        Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for
        allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided
        Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief
        executive.[30] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles
        under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic
        missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although
        the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time
        overruns.[30][31] Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the
        Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear
        tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive
        political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project
        Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing
        phase.[11][32] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the
        country's best known nuclear scientist.[33] However, the director of the
        site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a
        "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both
        Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[35] In 1998, along with
        cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named
        the "Kalam-Raju Stent".[36][37] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged
        tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the
        "Kalam-Raju Tablet".

      <h1>Presidency :</h1>
      <p>
        Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.
        He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884,
        surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from
        25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.[39] On 10 June 2002, the National
        Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that
        they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both
        the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his
        candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for
        Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the
        field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature: I am
        really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I
        have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to
        the people of the country at this juncture.[45] On 18 June, Kalam filed
        his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee
        and his senior Cabinet colleagues.[46] Kalam along with Vladimir Putin
        and Manmohan Singh during his presidency The polling for the
        presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state
        assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided
        affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held
        on 18 July.[47] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India
        in an easy victory,[48] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he
        was sworn in on 25 July.[49] Kalam was the third President of India to
        have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour,
        before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir
        Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later
        became the President of India.[50] He was also the first scientist and
        the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[51] During his term as
        president, he was affectionately known as the People's
        President,[52][53][54] saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was
        the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.[55][56][57] Kalam
        was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21
        mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.[58] Article 72 of
        the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant
        pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death
        row.[58][59] Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure
        as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was
        later hanged.[58] Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a
        Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001
        attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the
        Supreme Court of India in 2004.[59] While the sentence was scheduled to
        be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea
        resulted in him remaining on death row.[59] He also took the
        controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.[60]
        In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam
        supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the
        population of the country.[61][62][63][64] At the end of his term, on 20
        June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in
        office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007
        presidential election.[65] However, two days later, he decided not to
        contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid
        involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[66] He was
        proposed by third front named United National Progressive Alliance
        leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders
        Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the
        support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive
        a renewed mandate.[67][68] Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th
        President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April claimed
        that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.[69][70][71]
        After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a number of people
        supporting his candidature.[72][73] The BJP potentially backed his
        nomination[failed verification], saying that the party would lend their
        support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National
        Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential election.[74][75] A
        month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee
        also expressed their support for Kalam.[76] Indian National Congress
        opposed the nomination of Kalam in 2012.[77] Days afterwards, Mulayam
        Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary
        supporter.[78] On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012
        presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so: Many, many
        citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love
        and affection for me and the aspiration of the people. I am really
        overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect it. I want
        to thank them for the trust they have in me.

      <h1>Memorial :</h1>
      <p>
        The Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial[118] was built in memory
        of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu, in the island town of Rameswaram,
        Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July
        2017.[119][120] On display are the replicas of rockets and missiles
        which Kalam had worked with. Acrylic paintings about his life are also
        displayed along with hundreds of portraits depicting the life of the
        mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam in the entrance showing him
        playing the Veena. There are two other smaller statues of the leader in
        sitting and standing posture.
